Review
------

Die a Happy Man is one of Thomas Rhett's most popular songs. I personally like
Die a Happy Man, but it is not my favorite song by Thomas Rhett. The song can
be too slow for me, and I do not always enjoy listening to a slow song. Overall,
I would give this song a 7.5/10. It is a really good song by Thomas Rhett,
however, it is not a song that I could listen to a lot and it can easily grow
old to me.
