Review
------

Personally, I love this song by Iann Dior. I am a huge Iann Dior and pop fan so
this song is right up my alley. The beat is perfect to me. I love how it is uptempo
yet not overwhelming. You are able to listen to this song whether you are in a
relaxed mood or trying ot jam out. The lyrics also seem to really speak to me.
Dior talks about letting go of someone who he seems to have had an up and down
history with for the betterment of himself. I love how he is able to show
personal growth in a song and inspire others to put themselves first and grow in
their own respect. Keep in my ind I am not music expert, but I give this song a
9.5/10.
