Review
------

Personally, I love this song by Bazzi. Paradise is one of my most listened to
songs. I am a huge fan of feel good pop music, so
this song is right up my alley. Feel good pop is my go to because I never get sick
of it and there is no mood that it doesn't fit. The flow is perfect to me.
I love how it is slower yet not boring whatsoever. This song is perfect to listen
to on a nice drive or just chilling. It truly is a feel good song that improves
your mood instantly. I would give this song a 9.5/10 simply for the fact that I
can not stop listening to it and never get sick of it.
