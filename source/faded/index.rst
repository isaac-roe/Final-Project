EDM, also known as Electronic Dance Music. Suprisingly, EDM has been around since the 1970s.
In the 70s, it was known as disco music because it was used at disco parties. Now, we consider
discos as 'raves', renaming discos we renamed and revamped it as 'EDM'.

About Faded
-----------
*Faded*, one of the most popular songs of all time. It was originally named *Fade* in 2014.
Around the time it was released, Walker started his time with NCS. In 2015 Walker released a
vocal version with extra instruments.

Walker described his song as "happy yet emotional, appropriate for both sad and/or
uplifting occasions. It's about searching for someone, something or somewhere lost. Or
just feeling lost! One of the things I like most about its lyrics is that it can be interpreted
freely by the listener."
