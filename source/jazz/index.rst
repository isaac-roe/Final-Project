Jazz - Early and Classic
========================

Early Jazz, or more focused on "New Orleans Style" since New Orleans is
where a lot of major jazz music started, originated near the beginning of the
1900s. It originated with brass bands that would perform for parties and dances
in the early 1900s. Many of the instruments included tuba, banjo, clarinet,
saxophone, tuba, bass, guitar, drums & on the occasion, piano. This new music
took on many adaptations of popular melodies, hymns, work songs, marches, and
the Blues. This era of classic jazz even resurfaced for a bit in the 1990s.

Review
------
Personally I love Jazz music as much as any other type especially the early jazz
years. I think the music itself speaks to a lot of people and has a soul of its
own when it plays. One song that sticks out to me is "What A Wonderful World" by
Louis Armstrong because I've heard it since I was a little kid. My family sang
it, I sang it, my friends even sang it and it was such an amazing piece of music
that I still love today. I'm no music expert but the early years of Jazz hit
me in such a way that it just warms my heart when I hear it.
