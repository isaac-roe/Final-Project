Jazz - A Modern Time
====================
The term "modern" refers to something that is in the present or recent times
rather than something that occurred in the past tense. Modern jazz is jazz music
that is created close to or in the 21st century so in other words, the 80s, 90s,
and through the 2000s. It can cover a range of sub-genres but more commonly
refers to sound more current than swing, bebop and modal jazz and it might
take influence from other genres such as 20th century classical music or
non-western cultural sounds

Review
------
Modern jazz, or contemporary jazz as some call it, definitely has takes on a
life of its own. While it's not the classical songs we have heard from the past
and come to enjoy, modern jazz is still so amazing. The artists that provide us
these songs are truly gifted people. I have come to enjoy jazz music as a whole
whether it be old or new and suggest that if you son't listen to jazz and or
rarely that you go ahead and just listen to some of the music. It truly leaves
a good feeling.
