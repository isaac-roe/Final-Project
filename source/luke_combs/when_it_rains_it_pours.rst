Review
------

I personally think that this is one of Luke Combs's best works. It is a very catchy song that has a very interesting
story that goes along with it. This song is also one that gets attributed to Luke Combs a lot too. It is one of the
first works that really helped to kick start his career and get him to the place that he is today. Overall, I would
give this song a 9/10. I like pretty much everything about this song, and it always helps to put me in a good mood.
