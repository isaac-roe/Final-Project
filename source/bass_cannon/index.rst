About Bass Cannon
-----------------

*Bass Cannon* is a audio promotion. The video is at least PG-13, but we aren't here to talk about
the song. The song is loud, full of beats! It's one of those songs you play if you have a Sub
Woofer in your car and you have the bass all the way up. Your friend might not want to ever ride
in your car again, but you will have a lot of fun. The song is unique, its effective in the fact
that it will grab people's attention at the first beat.
